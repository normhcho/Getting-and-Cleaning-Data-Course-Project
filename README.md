# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
My submission for the final project of the Getting and Cleaning Data Course

This will include the following outputs:

[run_analysis.R](run.analysis.R)

[README.md](README.md)

[cookbook.md](cookbook.md)

[tidydata.txt](tidydata.txt)

The zip file represents a folder that contains information on the subjects, the 6 different actitivies, the features (or data columns), and test and training data.

From there, I wrote the script that combines the different elements in R, or more specifically, RStudio.

Afterwards, time was spent making the data labels more descriptive by replacing abbreivations with words where applicable.  In addition, the activities numeric values were replaced with actions.

Lastly, a tidy data set is produced from the original combined data set showing the mean by subjectID and activity.
